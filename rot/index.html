  <span class="child">Hi my name is HORNY GRANNY. I'm 74 years old. I am very similar to you. Did I mention to you that I'm a HORNY GRANNY? A few years ago a group of girls fucked HORNY GRANNY'S. Send this message to 15 HORNY GRANNY'S after you listened the whole message if you value your life. A boy called David received this message. He just left and deleted it. When he was in the shower he heard laughing. My laughter. He got really scared and rushed to his phone to repost this message but he was too late. The next morning his mom entered his bedroom and all she found was a message written in his blood saying 'You will never have the horny granny's back'. No one has found his body yet because he is with me. A girl called Charlotte received this message and she immediately sent it to 25 people, 10 more than required. I still watch over every second of her life to make sure that she is safe and to keep her and everyone close to her out of danger. Send this to 15 people in the next five minutes if you don't want your fate to be the same as David's. Your time starts now.the story is true you can research it on smug.ga</span>
